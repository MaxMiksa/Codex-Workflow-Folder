# Install Guide (Direct Track) — `openai.chatgpt >= 0.4.71`

> This document is a placeholder for the upcoming 71+ implementation.

## Current status

- Script path: `docs/remote/v71-plus/codex-folding-install.mjs`
- Behavior: intentionally exits with a clear “not implemented yet” error in this phase.

## Why this exists

- The project has been split into version tracks.
- `<=0.4.70` remains on the legacy implementation.
- `>=0.4.71` is isolated for dedicated follow-up development.

## What to use now

- Use the auto-routing main guide: `docs/INSTALL_FOR_AI.md`
- Or, if you are on `<=0.4.70`, use `docs/INSTALL_FOR_AI_v70-and-earlier.md`
